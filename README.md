# Hybrid-Public-Space-Template
A website template for passing Markdown to Html and having the footnotes as  side notes

# Change the content

The Thesis.md file is the content of my thesis but change it to your own Markdown to test the layout.

# Footnote to Side notes

Pandoc templating always put the references as footnotes.

The advantage ot this template is that it will take all the foot notes like this:


Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.

[^1]: This is the first footnote.


and transform them in side notes that will match the position of the reference in the scroll of the text.
